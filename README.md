# Piwik FeedAnnotation Plugin

This is a plugin for the Open Source Web Analytics platform Piwik. It allows you to automatically fetch RSS/Atom-Feeds from your website and create new Annotations from feed entries. 

Since the "Annotations" plugin was introduced in Piwik 1.10, this plugin requires at least Piwik 1.10.
